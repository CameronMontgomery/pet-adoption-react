# Pet-Adoption-React

## Overview 
I started this project to get deeper, more thorough understanding of React and its features. The initial version of the project uses Javascript, React, Vite, and React Query. It allowed me to get further experience with React Query's caching capabilities, client-side routing, portals, class components, controlled/uncontrolled forms, creating error boundaries, context, and using ESLint, Prettier, and plugins to help development.

After compleating version 1.0, I wanted to continue using the project as a learning platform to gain exposure to other tools that are trending in the React community. 

I first branched into refactoring the project from a single global stylesheet to use TailwindCSS. This was my first experience using Tailwind and I think that it has a lot of merit when it comes to quickly creating a layout and styling. I personally liked working with it more than more opinionated design frameworks like Material UI and Bootstrap. The branch provided insight for me into Tailwind basics, apply, breakpoints, and plugins.
